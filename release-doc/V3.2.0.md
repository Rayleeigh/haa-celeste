# What is new?
> V3.2.0 — Mission Type Icons & Dossier Briefing

## Overview
Mission briefings now display their classification type with a visual icon and a redesigned dossier-style layout. Each mission is linked to a type defined in `mission_types.json`, and the briefing panel presents intel in a structured, professional format.

## New Features

### Mission Type Icons
- Each mission type (Application, Documentation, Automation, Coaching) has a dedicated icon displayed in the briefing panel
- Icons render with transparent backgrounds and a cyan glow drop-shadow
- Hover effect scales the icon and intensifies the glow
- White backgrounds removed from all icon PNGs via automated processing

### Dossier-Style Briefing Layout
- Header row with the mission type icon on the right and a classification badge on the left
- Type badge styled as a monospace uppercase label with a subtle border
- Hovering or clicking the header row reveals the mission type description with a smooth expand animation
- "MISSION INTEL" and "BRIEFING" section dividers with gradient lines
- 2-column intel grid with labeled field cards for codename, operation, coordinates, and target link
- Briefing narrative section only renders when a description is present

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files
- `js/globe.js` — Rewrote the `selectMission()` HTML template from a basic list to the new dossier layout with click-to-expand type description
- `css/main.css` — Replaced old `mission-data-*` classes with new `brief-*` design system (dossier container, header row, intel grid, dividers, narrative)
- `index.html` — Removed inline `<style>` rules that were moved into `main.css`
- `data/missions.json` — Updated mission type IDs to match `mission_types.json` (`documentation`, `application`)
- `data/mission_types.json` — Updated icon filenames to match available assets

### Asset Changes
- `mission-icons/*.png` — Removed white backgrounds from all 4 icons (app, archive, automation, structure) for clean rendering on dark UI
