# What is new?
> V3.2.0 — Helldivers Globe Mission Select

## Overview
Complete redesign of the landing page from a traditional scrolling layout to an interactive 3D globe mission select interface inspired by Helldivers. Each section of the site is now a clickable mission point on a rotating globe, with holographic briefing panels and a military sci-fi HUD aesthetic.

## New Features

### Three.js Globe Interface
- Full-screen interactive 3D wireframe globe with atmosphere glow shader
- 6 mission markers placed at real-world lat/lon coordinates on the globe
- Auto-rotation with manual drag support via OrbitControls
- Camera fly-to animation when selecting a mission target
- Pulsing marker animations and star particle background

### Holographic Briefing Panels
- Slide-in briefing panel with scanline animation and glitch text effects
- Each mission loads its section content (About, Projects, Tech Stack, Homelab, Naming, Contact) into the panel
- Previous/Next navigation between missions with counter display
- ESC key and close button to dismiss

### HUD Overlay
- Fixed tactical HUD frame with corner brackets and status bars
- Live date/time display in the top status bar
- Animated LAT/LON coordinate counter that rapidly ticks to the target mission's coordinates on selection
- "SYSTEM ONLINE" indicator with blinking status light

### Quick Select Sidebar
- Hamburger toggle button on the left side of the screen
- Slide-out mission list panel with numbered entries
- Active mission highlighting in amber
- Click any mission to instantly navigate to it

### Default Mission Selection
- "About Me" mission is automatically selected on page load
- Coordinates animate back to the About Me position when closing a panel

### HQ Command Panel
- Always-visible profile card in the bottom-left corner
- Displays avatar, name, role, repo/follower/following stats
- GitHub profile link button
- Data populated from the GitHub API with local JSON fallback

## Technical Changes

### New Files
- `js/globe.js` — Three.js scene, globe rendering, mission markers, raycaster interaction, camera fly-to, coordinate animation, panel logic, quick select sidebar, and prev/next navigation

### Modified Files
- `index.html` — Full restructure to globe-based layout with HUD overlay, template-based section content, briefing panel, quick select sidebar, and HQ panel
- `js/main.js` — Refactored to populate the new panel-based layout while keeping GitHub API fetch logic intact
- `scss/main.scss` — Complete restyle for dark fullscreen HUD aesthetic, holographic panels, mission labels, animations, and responsive breakpoints
- `css/main.css` — Compiled output from SCSS

### Dependencies
- Three.js r128 (via CDN)
- Three.js OrbitControls (via CDN)
